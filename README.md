# bio3d-binder
Launchable, working Jupyter-baseed environment with bio3D package for Biological Structure Analysis running in RStudio with some examples

The badge above will open with Jupyter+R (R as kernel. Alternatively, if you wish to work in RStudio, you can switch after it opens. To switch, edit the URL to replace the `notebooks/index.ipynb` with `rstudio` in the address bar of your browser. It should then open RStudio. At this time, you can access the same code by opening the R script, `bio3d_use.R`. I'll try to keep them the same but it is best to check if the one in `bio3d_use.R` seems to be lacking something you saw when the notebook opened in default mode.
